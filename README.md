This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
In this regression task I will predict the percentage of a student based on the number of hours they study. 

# _Task Description_
In this task we are provided with a simple dataset of the number of hours studied by a student vs their score. We have to model this data using supervised ML technique linear regression and use that to make predictions on new data.

# Data Description
1. The data consists of two variables namely hours and scores.
2. The hours column has Float data type
3. The Scores column has Integer data type
4. There are no missing values or duplicate data

# General Insight into the data
After plotting the point on a scatter plot I discovered that there is a linear relationship between the number of hours studied and the score of a student. This makes linear regression a very good choice for modelling the relationship between the two variables.

# Final question to answer
We need to predict the score of a student who studies 9.25 hrs/day.
